VaporGCM is a simple, yet elegant, Swift library that allows you to send GCM Push Notifications in Linux & macOS.

## üîß Installation

A quick guide, step by step, about how to use this library.

### 1- Install libcurl with http/2 support

In macOS using `brew` you can easily do with:

```shell
brew reinstall curl --with-openssl --with-nghttp2
brew link curl --force
```

### 2- Add VaporGCM to your project

Add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.Package(url:"https://github.com/matthijs2704/vapor-gcm.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1)
```

And then run `vapor fetch` command, if you have the Vapor toolbox installed.

## üöÄ Usage

It's really easy to get started with the VaporAPNS library! First you need to import the library, by adding this to the top of your Swift file:
